# Dockerfile for Spoke-Base

# Updates are done here to allow for the Spoke container to be only focused on

# By default, the contents of '/data' is owned by root (set in the
# radial/hub-base Dockerfile) with 755 folder permissions. If this folder, or
# any of it's subfolders, need to have different permissions or ownership, it
# must be done in the entrypoint.sh script for that spokes application. Since
# '/data' is a volume container, this cannot be done in any of the Dockerfiles
# themselves. Remember to actually run your application as the appropriate
# user. 

# On the resulting Spoke container, this init script will take care of
# launching our Spokes "entrypoint.sh" script, passing it signals, and sending
# std{out|err} to either log files, the docker daemon, or both.

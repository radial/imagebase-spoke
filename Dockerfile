# Dockerfile for Spoke-Base
# 
# This Spoke-Base Dockerfile adds a required package for Spoke container
# management in the Radial topology. Supervisor is used as the main interface
# for `docker attach` as well as for managing the running process contained
# therein. Installation is done here to allow for the Spoke container to be only
# focused on the application code.

# By default, the contents of '/data' is owned by root (set in the
# radial/hub-base Dockerfile) with 755 folder permissions. If this folder, or
# any of it's subfolders, need to have different permissions or ownership, it
# must be done in the entrypoint.sh script for that spokes application (the one
# started in the Supervisor .ini file). Since '/data' is a volume container,
# this cannot be done in any of the Dockerfiles themselves. Remember to
# actually run your application as the appropriate user. You can set this
# information in your Supervisor .ini file for this program located in
# '/config/supervisor/conf.d'.
# Supervisor itself will be run as root regardless.

# On the resulting Spoke container, this ENTRYPOINT script will:
# 1) Create a unique folder for all our logs based on our container name
# 2) Start the supervisor daemon
# 3) Start this Spoke's main app group and
# 4) Show the combined output of the app and Supervisor
